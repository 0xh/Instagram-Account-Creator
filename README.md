# Instagram-Account-Creator
A Instagram account creator in C#


Please note instagram blocks too many requests from the same IP so you will have to implement you own proxy stuff.

If you keep getting the "Username in use" error then you might need to change IP's

If the IP is flagged for spam and the account is created instagram may ban the account straight after so you might want to check that.
